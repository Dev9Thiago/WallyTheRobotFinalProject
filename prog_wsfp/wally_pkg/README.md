# Robot with integrated AI project

This project implements an UML class diagram, state machines and a GUI that controls the program (Robot aka Wally).

# Members of the project

- Duvan Santiago Pérez Melo.
- Nicolás Rocha Sanchez.

# Goal of the project

This project's main goal is to create an interactive interface with in real time changes that allow the user to use the robot, aka Wally, in different testing scenarios to see how the robot would react in each case and how it could perform in a real world scenario.

# Python files

The "_init_.py" file collects all the modules that are part of the class diagram UML model.

The "stmch.py" file contains the code for the state machine.

The "guifunction.py" file controls the interface used to control the robot and to display all the test cases provided to show the program working correctly.

# Libraries used

The main library used is the "transitions" library, which allows the state machine work as intended.
